Solving linear systems\n\nThe following code can be used to generate a 1000 by 1000 matrix $A$ and subsequently construct a linear system whose solution `x` is in $\\mathbb{R}^{1000}$.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(100)\nA <- matrix(rnorm(500 * 1000), ncol = 500)\nA <- cbind(A, A + matrix(rnorm(500 * 1000, sd = .1), ncol = 500))\nx <- rnorm(1000)\nb <- A %*% x\n```\n:::\n\n\n1. Compute and interpret the condition number of $A$. \n\n2. If we did not know `x`, we could estimate `x` using either `solve(A) %*% b` or `solve(A, b)`. Use the `Sys.time()` function (or a similar function) to show that one of these approaches is faster. Why is this approach faster?\n\n3. Which approach yields a better estimate of `x`? Calculate the mean squared error of both approaches. \n\n## B. Least squares problems\n\nUsing the `flights` data from the `nycflights13` package, we will implement linear regression. \n\n1. Remove all rows with `NA` values from the `flights` data frame. Let `n` be the number of remaining rows. Construct an $n$ by 2 matrix $X$ where the first column is all 1s (for the intercept) and the second column contains the variable `distance`. Construct a length-$n$ vector `y` containing the variable `air_time`.\n\n2. Use the `chol`, `backsolve`, and `forwardsolve` functions to obtain the least squares solution $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol\\beta}=\\arg\\min_{\\boldsymbol\\beta}||\\mathbf{y}-X\\boldsymbol\\beta||^2$.\n\n3. Use the `qr` function and either `backsolve` or `forwardsolve` to obtain the least squares solution $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol\\beta}=\\arg\\min_{\\boldsymbol\\beta}||\\mathbf{y}-X\\boldsymbol\\beta||^2$.\n\n4. Use the `svd` function to compute the pseudoinverse of $X$ and obtain the least squares solution $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol\\beta}$.\n\n5. Use the `lm` function to verify that your estimates from 2, 3, and 4 agree with the standard R linear regression implementation.",
