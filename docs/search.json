    "text": "Course learning outcomes\nThis course provides an introduction to key mathematical concepts for multivariate and high-dimensional data analysis. In particular, this course focuses on using matrix computation and dimension reduction techniques to visualize and draw conclusions from high-dimensional data. Mathematical topics covered include linear algebra concepts and matrix decompositions that are used for data analysis and visualization (ex. factor analysis, principal components analysis, canonical correlation analysis, multidimensional scaling) and for unsupervised and supervised machine learning methods (ex. spectral clustering, linear discriminant analysis). These ideas will be applied to visualize and analyze real-world examples of high-dimensional datasets. The programming language R will be used to implement the methods and algorithms discussed in class.\nUpon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:\n\nUse software to carry out various linear algebra operations\nPlot and visualize data of various types in software and create publication-quality graphics\nPerform matrix singular value decomposition and other advanced linear algebra operations and interpret their results in the context of data analysis\nApply dimensionality reduction to high dimensional data and visualize them in low dimensions\nDevelop a basic understanding of the machine learning task of clustering",

    "text": "Course requirements and grading\n\nHomework: Throughout the semester, you complete homework assignments. You will typically have two weeks for a homework assignment. At the end of the quarter, your lowest lab grade will be dropped.\nExams: There will be two exams during the semester. Practice questions will be provided in advance of the exams. There will be no make-up exams.\nFinal project: During the semester, you will complete a class project that requires you to apply the data manipulation, visualization, and analysis skills covered in this course to a real-world dataset of your choice. Throughout the semester, you will submit a project proposal and multiple checkpoint assignments that will help you to prepare a final report and presentation.\nLate Work: In general, the late policy is as follows: Any assignment that is received late but less than 24 hours late will receive a grade penalty of 25%. Any assignment that is received 24 to 48 hours late will receive a grade penalty of 50%. Assignments will not be accepted more than 48 hours late. Extensions for academic purposes (ex. conference presentation or job interview) or extreme circumstances (ex. illness, emergency) will generally be granted. If you would like to request an extension, please do your best to email me at least 24 hours before an assignment is due, along with the reason. \n\nSuccess in this course is based on the expectation that students will spend, for each unit of credit, a minimum of 45 hours over the length of the course (normally three hours per unit per week) for instruction, preparation/studying, or course related activities, including but not limited to internships, labs, and clinical practica. Other course structures will have equivalent workload expectations as described in the syllabus.\n\nGrading scale\nYour final grade will be calculated as follows:\n\n25%: Homework\n25%: Exam 1 \n25%: Exam 2\n25%: Final project\n\nThere may be the opportunity for extra credit.\n\n\n\nLetter Grade\nRaw Percentage\n\n\n\n\nA plus\n96 to 100%\n\n\nA\n93 to 95%\n\n\nA minus\n90 to 92%\n\n\nB plus\n86 to 89%\n\n\nB\n83 to 85%\n\n\nB minus\n80 to 82%\n\n\nC plus\n76 to 79%\n\n\nC\n73 to 75%\n\n\nC minus\n70 to 72%\n\n\nD plus\n66 to 69%\n\n\nD\n63 to 65%\n\n\nD minus\n60 to 62%\n\n\nF\n0 to 60%",

Your goal is to examine the partisanship of U.S. Congress using the singular value decomposition. I strongly recommend saving a version of the unprocessed .csv files on your machine so you will be able to work offline. The data are available at:\n\n118th House of Representatives\n118th Senate\n\n\n\nrc columns stand for roll calls. Each vote has it’s own roll call. The code is as follows:\n\n1: “Yea” vote\n-1: “Nay” vote\n0: Abstain or not present during roll call\n\n\n\nRead the Introduction, Voting Patterns, and Conclusions sections of this research article (Porter et al., 2005). Based on the authors’ explanation, what do the left singular vectors of their analysis represent? What do the right singular vectors represent?\nWhat interpretations do Porter et al. assign to their first two left singular vectors? Do you think these are reasonable interpretations? Why or why not?\nLoad the 118th House data into R and use the svd function to perform singular value decomposition on the votes data. Plot a scatter plot using your first two left singular vectors, using color to indicate political party affiliation (be sure to give the colors interpretable labels). What interpretations, if any, can you assign to the first two left singular vectors? How do your results compare with Porter et al.’s results?\nWhat proportion of variance in the data do your first two left singular vectors account for? What does this indicate?\nRepeat this analysis for the 118th Senate data. Compare and contrast your results for the two datasets.\n\n\n\nPrincipal components analysis\nFor this portion of the lab, you may select any dataset that interests you with which to carry out a principal components analysis.\n\nChoose a dataset and provide a brief description of your selected dataset. What does each row and column represent? You should choose a dataset with enough numerical variables to make PCA or some other dimension reduction approach appropriate (ex &gt; 5).\nCarry out a principal components analysis using your dataset. You may use the prcomp function in R or compute the principal components by hand.\nProvide a biplot of the first two principal components and their variable loadings and comment on your findings. Are the first two principal components interpretable? What are the limitations of using principal components analysis with your data?"

    "text": "This course culminates with a project in which you will explore a dataset or dimension reduction technique of your choice. Examples of appropriate projects include the following:\n\nPresent a dimension reduction method not covered in class. You should introduce the key technical details of your algorithm and demonstrate your selected approach on a real dataset.\nProvide a tutorial introducing a dimension reduction method covered in this course at a level suitable for junior/senior undergraduate students or graduate students. You should apply your method to a real-world dataset, review your selected approach, explore different options and parameter configurations, and discuss strengths, weaknesses, and potential pitfalls of your approach.\nCompare two or more dimension reduction methods covered in this course using a real-world dataset or simulated data. Review the technical details of your selected approaches, discuss differences in their performance, and offer practical advice on choosing a dimension reduction technique in your chosen setting.\nExtend an existing dimension reduction method or review a theoretical result/paper not discussed in class.\n\nYou may work in groups of two students or three students. All members of a group are responsible for contributing to all parts of the project. You may work independently on your project with the instructor’s approval. If you would like to work on your own, you must meet with the instructor before submitting your project proposal. During the semester, you will submit a written project proposal which must be approved by the instructor. At the end of the semester, you will deliver a short oral presentation on your project and submit a written report of your results as well as a brief reflection and self-evaluation.\nYour project will be evaluated based on the following aspects of your work:\n\nTechnical Details: clearly and correctly presenting the technical details of your selected dimension reduction algorithm(s) and dataset(s). In other words, a peer who hasn’t taken this class should be able to understand how your method works based on your explanation.\nApplication: appropriately applying your selected method(s) to real or simulated data, producing effective visualizations, and correctly interpreting the results.\nExposition and Presentation: producing a written report and delivering your oral presentation.\n\nThis project is intentionally open-ended: there are no predetermined right answers. Exceptional projects will demonstrate mastery of the course material and involve more than a superficial review of a method covered in class or application using a toy dataset.",
